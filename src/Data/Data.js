        description:"As a job, being a professional wedding photographer involves an exciting mix of portraiture and event photography in a wide variety of settings and groups. Wedding photography is pretty intense, with the element of getting the best shot on the first try and not really getting a second chance in some situations. The emphasis is on capturing the moment and documenting natural, candid pictures that the family will treasure for a lifetime. Wedding photographers have to be quick on their feet, moving around during events, and there are substantial sales and customer service components to their jobs. They also have to be adaptable, ready to shoot outdoors on a sunny day and indoors for dimly lit receptions and dances. Couples will expect direction from the photographer for posing shots and settings, so the photographer must be confident and communicate well with the bride and groom.",

        description:"In the same vein, event photography is a dynamic and fast-paced way to make a buck with your camera. Whether your beat is corporate events or wild and crazy rock concerts, event photographers work in a variety of settings. Event photography styles often involve a mixture of photojournalistic documentary work and portraiture. Some organizations use their event photos for publicity purposes, while other use party photos as souvenirs or keepsakes.",

        description:"Product photography covers a lot of ground. Food photography is a specialized niche, and restaurants need to advertise their meals and create their menus. Jewelry is another favorite type of product photography since this requires the perfect balance of light and preparation. While some product shoots might involve models, many times you will be working solo in a studio doing still life photographs of small objects.",

        description:"Of all of the types of photography, this is the one with no rules. Fine art photographers create art. They display their work in galleries and at art shows, and generally, they sell a finished, framed print product to their customers. Fine art photography can be of any subject at all, but landscape and portrait artists are probably the most common. Fine art images are about capturing emotional responses and communicating with the audience.",

From cover shots of the top fashion magazines to documenting the latest styles and trends on the runway, fashion photographers work in the design districts of New York, Paris, and Milan. Runway shoots require an element of documentary photography, while posed shoots on location demand one-on-one work with the model.",
